<h1 class="title toc-ignore">The heatmap of positive increase rate</h1>
<h4 class="author">Xinyi Liu</h4>

</div>


<p>This page shows the third interactive visualization: the heatmap of the trend of positive increase rate of each state in the U.S.</p>
<div id="process-covid-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Process COVID data</h1>
<p>For this visualization, I used two variables: <code>positiveIncrease</code> and <code>totalTestResultsIncrease</code> from the COVID tracking project which are the daily increase of confirmed cases and PCR tests calculated based on the previous day’s value.</p>
<p>I also created a variable called <code>positiveIncreaseRate</code> which is calculated by dividing the <code>positiveIncrease</code> by the <code>totalTestResultsIncrease</code> (the rate will be 0 if <code>totalTestResultsIncrease</code> itself is 0) to calculate the daily confirmed case increase rate at state-level. PIR(<code>positiveIncreaseRate</code>) represents the percentage of daily PCR test results that are positive.</p>
