# Data

## COVID-19 Data

[The COVID tracking project](https://covidtracking.com/) collected state-level metrics for COVID-19 cases, tests, hospitalizations, and outcomes from 2020/01/13 to 2021/03/07. There are 20780 state-level COVID-19 observations of 56 variables, including the number of positive cases, tests, deaths and individuals who are currently hospitalized with COVID-19 etc. 

We focused on the `positiveIncrease` and `totalTestResultsIncrease` variable, which is the daily increase of confirmed cases and PCR tests calculated based on the previous dayâ€™s value. Following the suggestions in [this article](https://covidtracking.com/analysis-updates/how-day-of-week-effects-impact-covid-19-data), we used the 7-day average to show the general trends of data over a period of time due to the complexities of state reporting schedules and day-of-week effects. 

To ensure the collected data is accurate and stabilized, we only analysed records in 2021 as the data collection at the beginning of the pandemic may contain many errors.

## Vaccination Data

Besides COVID-19 cases data, we also want to see if the difference between states is associated with vaccination. Therefore, we used the state-level COVID-19 Vaccinations data in the United States from [Centers for Disease Contol and Prevention](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-Jurisdi/unsk-b7fc). CDC also provides data API so that we can acquire vaccination data on 2021-01-03 which is the beginning date in our COVID-19 data records. We focused on the `Admin_Per_100K` variable which is the total number of doses administered per 100,000 census population based on the jurisdiction where the recipient lives.

## State Data

It's noticeable that there are 65 locations in the vaccination data while there are only 48 contiguous united states. This is because the `location` variable from CDC contains state, territory and federal entities. To keep only the contiguous united states, we used a [state dataset](https://developers.google.com/public-data/docs/canonical/states_csv) that is used in Google DSPL and [us_census_data](https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/associated-data/tree/master/us_census_data) to access the population and population density of each state.
