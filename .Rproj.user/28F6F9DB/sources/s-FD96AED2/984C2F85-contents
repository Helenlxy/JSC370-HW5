This page shows the third interactive visualization: the heatmap of the trend of positive increase rate of each state in the U.S.

# Process COVID data

```{r}
library(data.table)
library(dtplyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
#library(mgcv)
library(knitr)
#library(magrittr)
library(lubridate)
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(widgetframe)
```

```{r}
source("process_COVID_data.R")
```

For this visualization, I used two variables: `positiveIncrease` and `totalTestResultsIncrease` from the COVID tracking project which are the daily increase of confirmed cases and PCR tests calculated based on the previous dayâ€™s value.

I also created a variable called `positiveIncreaseRate` which is calculated by dividing the `positiveIncrease` by the `totalTestResultsIncrease` (the rate will be 0 if `totalTestResultsIncrease` itself is 0) to calculate the daily confirmed case increase rate at state-level. PIR(`positiveIncreaseRate`) represents the percentage of daily PCR test results that are positive.

# Display

```{r}
cv_states_mat <- merged_data %>%
  select(name, End_of_Week, positiveIncreaseRate)

PIR <- as.data.frame(pivot_wider(cv_states_mat, names_from = name, values_from = positiveIncreaseRate))

PIR <- PIR %>%
  column_to_rownames("End_of_Week") %>%
  as.matrix()

plot_ly(x=colnames(PIR), y=rownames(PIR), z=~PIR, type="heatmap")%>%
  layout(title = "The heatmap of the trend of PIR",
         hovermode = "compare")

```
# Interpret

The heatmap shows that Idaho, Alabama and Iowa have a significant high PIR at the beginning of 2021. The PIR decreases from January to March for all states in general.
